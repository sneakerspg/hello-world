# hello-world
This is my first repository, used for testing.

I am learning how to code in javascript, and this is, apparently, the place to keep my stuff!
I work on a Mac, I have 20 years' experience in software for the veterinary field, and I am working on a project in that field now.  I live near San Diego, CA, and the weather is (almost) always perfect here!
